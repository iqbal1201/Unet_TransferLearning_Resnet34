## PALM OIL SEMANTIC SEGMENTATIOn USING UNET-RESNET34

The project aims to enhance the accuracy of palm oil plantation segmentation by integrating the U-Net architecture with transfer learning from ResNet-34. U-Net’s symmetric structure and skip connections are adept at capturing spatial hierarchies, while ResNet-34’s pre-trained layers on vast datasets offer robust feature extraction capabilities. By combining these models, the project seeks to create a powerful semantic segmentation tool that can precisely delineate palm oil plantation areas from varied satellite imagery, contributing to more informed and sustainable agricultural practices. This approach not only promises improvements in segmentation precision but also expedites the training process, leveraging the strengths of both architectures for superior performance.
